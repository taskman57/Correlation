# Correlation Project

This repository contains:
- **Octave/MATLAB scripts** for signal processing and analysis.
- **Implementation files** of correlation algorithms in **Vitis HLS** and **VHDL**.

The goal of this project is to provide reference implementations and scripts for experimenting with and testing correlation methods.
